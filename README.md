# Reinforcement-Learning-Example
Some little project about reinforcement learning, about how to setup and build an agent.
# Junia Racer
### Context
It's a simple 2D car game, with the aim of completing 3 laps as quickly as possible without touching the edges. If an edge is touched, the car starts again from the beginning, so you have to complete the 3 laps without colliding.

So, the project was given to me functional (the game) with movement using the keyboard arrows

### Solution

# MouseMaze
## No Random map
## Random map

# Snake
